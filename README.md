# InterviewPrep

## Description

This repository contains Java code samples demonstrating essential technical programming interview concepts and topics,
including:

- Data Structures (Lists, Maps, Stacks, Queues, Trees, etc), including **special/useful classes** and use cases.
- Interfaces
- Input/Output (IO)
- Bit Manipulation
- Other optional topics including
    - Streams
    - Generics
    - Reflection

## Importing the Project to an IDE

IntelliJ IDEA Community is the desired IDE.

To import the project:

- Open IntelliJ IDEA.
- On the left under _Project_, click _Get from VCS_.
- Select _Git_ in the _Version Control_ dropdown (if Git is not available, download [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
  for your operating system.
- Enter __https://github.com/mattgoespro/InterviewPrep__ as the Git URL.
- Select your desired directory to generate the IDEA project files.
- Click _Clone_.

IntelliJ should automatically detect a Gradle project and download Gradle and the project dependencies if not already
available.

## Configuring IDE Settings

The project relies on the Lombok Gradle plugin (bundled with IntelliJ under _File | Settings | Plugins_) to reduce
boilerplate code, which requires enabling annotation processing.

To enable annotation processing:

- Navigate to _File | Settings | Build, Execution, Deployment | Compiler | Annotation Processors_, and turn on _
  Annotation Processing_.

If you are familiar with Eclipse and its keybindings, an Eclipse Keymap plugin is available as a plugin. Download the
plugin by opening IntelliJ. On the left, click _Plugins_. Search _Eclipse Keymap_ and click _Install_.
