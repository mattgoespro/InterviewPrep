## Configuring IDE Settings

The project relies on the Lombok Gradle plugin to reduce boilerplate code, which requires enabling annotation processing. To enable: Navigate to _File | Settings | Build, Execution, Deployment | Compiler | Annotation Processors_, and turn on _Annotation Processing_.

If you are familiar with Eclipse and its key bindings, an Eclipse Keymap plugin is available as a plugin. Download the plugin by opening IntelliJ. On the left, click _Plugins_. Search _Eclipse Keymap_ and click _Install_.
